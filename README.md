An approach for evaluating learning materials using the knowledge graph is presented here.

We propose an approach to automatically generate a knowledge graph and save it to a graph database; and subsequent evaluation of learning materials, using tests as an example, using LLM+GraphRAG - which allows extracting relevant nodes from the graph and feeding them into a language model.
